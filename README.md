<h1> FINC.780 </h1>
Financial Analytics (Summer 2021)

<h2> Syllabus Course Description: </h2>

Finance is increasing a data-driven and computationally-intensive field. This course introduces data-driven applications such as portfolio analysis, technical analysis, trading algorithms, security pricing, and information disclosure analysis. Although not a programming course per-se, students will learn how to write functions and code using the R language with some work also using a second language (Python). R is increasingly the tool of choice for finance and students will learn not only “base R” (the core capabilities of the language) but also key packages written specifically for finance. Students will also be exposed to the world of financial information – specifically, they will use data extractions from sources such as Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, and the SEC website.

<h2> Languages and Tools Used: </h2>

* Python
